# Loan Data Analysis - SQL Server | Power BI | DAX
This project dives into loan data analysis, exploring borrower behavior, default patterns, and overall lending performance. I used Power BI to build interactive dashboards and created multiple custom columns & DAX measures to uncover insights that raw data alone couldnâ€™t show.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

- Data Source: Loan dataset (borrower info, loan details, repayment history).
Data Cleaning & Transformation:

- Removed duplicates and missing values.

- Standardized column formats (dates, categories, IDs).

- Created calculated columns for better segmentation.

DAX Measures (Custom Calculations):

- Default loan ratio

- Year-on-Year loan growth

- Active vs. closed loans

Visuals & Insights:

- Loan distribution by year, amount, and type

- Default trends and risk segmentation

- Repayment patterns by customer demographics


## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Power BI â€“ Dashboarding & visualizations

- DAX â€“ Custom measures & calculated columns

- SQL Server


## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow

- Data Ingestion â€” Raw data uploaded to SQL Server.

- Data Transformation â€” Cleaned & transformed in Power Query Editor and SQL.

- Visualization â€” Connected Power BI  for dynamic dashboards.
